# Auto-GAADI
The term "Automotive Industries" refers to all businesses and endeavours concerned 
with the production of motor vehicles, including the majority of its parts, such as their 
engines and bodywork, but excludes their tyres, batteries, and fuel.
The automotive industry continues to face a growing number of challenges and 
pressures. Cost pressure, competition, globalization, market shifts, and volatility are all 
increasing. 
The background of the **"AUTO-GAADI"** project would involve data analysis and 
machine learning techniques to predict the price of a car and analyze the trends in car 
sales.
 
To carry out this project, you would need access to a large dataset of car sales 
information, including factors such as car price, model, year, mileage, condition, 
location, and price. This data can be collected from various sources such as online 
car sales platforms, car dealerships, and public records.
The project would involve data cleaning and preparation to ensure that the data is 
accurate and consistent. This would include removing any missing or duplicate, 
converting data into a standardized format, and identifying any outliers or 
anomalies.
Overall, the project would require a strong understanding of data analysis and 
machine learning techniques, as well as a background in programming and 
statistics.

The goal of this web app is to understand key performance indicators for 
automotive industry in the US and to predict the price of the Car with respect 
to Car Age, Fuel Type, Transmission Type and others .
We have trained our model with different datasets taken from “Data.world “ 
and The data consisted of 48 car brands and in total 915 different car models.
This Price Prediction in our project is going to help the user to buy and sell a 
car with an unbiased price easily and without any loss
