# Auto-GAADI
The term "Automotive Industries" refers to all businesses and endeavours concerned 
with the production of motor vehicles, including the majority of its parts, such as their 
engines and bodywork, but excludes their tyres, batteries, and fuel.
The automotive industry continues to face a growing number of challenges and 
pressures. Cost pressure, competition, globalization, market shifts, and volatility are all 
increasing.   

The background of the **"AUTO-GAADI"** project would involve data analysis and 
machine learning techniques to predict the price of a car and analyze the trends in car 
sales.

The current car sales industry faces a challenge in terms of transparency and 
consistency in pricing. There is a lack of standardization in pricing methods, 
and prices can vary significantly across different regions, dealerships, and 
sales channels. This can create confusion for buyers, and it can be difficult for 
sellers to determine the fair market value of a vehicle. 
AUTO-GAADI can provide more reliable and accurate pricing information to 
help buyers and sellers make informed decisions.  


The foundation of this project is **Random Forest Regression**. It is a type of machine learning algorithm that is used for predicting 
continuous values (regression). It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision 
trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the prediction.
The basic idea behind the random forest regression algorithm is to construct multiple decision trees on 
randomly selected subsets of the training data, and then aggregate the predictions of all the trees to 
arrive at the final prediction. Each decision tree is constructed based on a random subset of features, 
and at each node of the tree, the best split is chosen from a random subset of features.
The final prediction of the random forest regression model is the average of the predictions of all the 
decision trees. This averaging process helps to reduce the variance of the predictions and improve the 
overall accuracy of the model
